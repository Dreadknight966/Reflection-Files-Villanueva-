            Personal Background
            <br>
            I have an intermediate understanding of cybersecurity and protecting my personal devices and have been able to teach my family members the basics of navigating the cyber space. I have the most basic knowledge of the legality and laws regarding cybercrimes and many malicious things that go around the internet. And have build up habits in order to surf the internet responsibly. 
            <br>
            Reflection
            <br>
            Republic Act 10175 known as the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 which was enacted due to the increasing cybercrimes in the Philippines. This law aims to protect individuals who may fall victim to scams, hacking and identify theft, as well as punishing individuals who may partake in illegal activities online such as distributing illegal pornography or selling of illegal items: Weapons, Drugs, Human Trafficking. The act discusses punishments for individuals found guilty of committing cybercrimes depending on the severity of the crime as  well as the accountability for the criminal in question.

            The PNP anti-cybercrime group is the enforcing group of republic act 10175. They actively investigate and prevent cybercrime using their extensive network and members in order to protect the users who are oblivious to such acts going on in the background. They Coordinate with international enforcement agencies in order to apprehend criminals across borders. They upgrade their hardware and infrastructure in order to stay ahead and compete with the evolving threats that may happen at any moment. They train their forces in order to have expertise to stay effective as well as hire experts.

            Key takeaways
            <br>
            The role of the PNP are very crucial. Because more and more people are becoming more reliant to the internet in storing their personal information both public and private. And it is important to protect that data. Because these data can be used to control people's life and unfortunately most are unaware if that info is vulnerable to such attacks or where it may come from. The PNP is the specialized unit we need in order to combat cybercrime but also create public awareness about the importance of Cybersecurity.
            <br>
            As I grow older I learn more and more regarding the inner intricacies of the digital world and gain new insight with the mistakes I have made in the past. And as I learn more I realized the importance of continuing to learn as these threats also evolve to exploit us. Although these laws are imperfect it is indeed a step in the right direction for us to have a safer and more secure internet for us to use and interact in. It is important to impose these acts as the newer generation will most likely need the internet and must tackle these malicious people and their data needs to be protected.
